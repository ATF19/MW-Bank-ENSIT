# MaibornWolff Bank - An ENSIT Exercice

This is a small exercice to work on the onion architecture and test driven development.

To get started, simply pull or clone the repo and do the following:
1. Since we will only be working on the backend, we can simply serve the frontend build. If you don't have `serve` installed, you can set it up by running `npm install -g serve`.
After installing `serve`, just navigate to the frontend build folder and serve it by running the following:
```bash
cd mw-bank-frontend/build
serve -p 3000
```
2. Open the backend projet (in `mw-bank-backend`) using your favorite IDE and use `./mvnw spring-boot:run` to start the server.
